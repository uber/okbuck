# OkBuck
[![CI](https://github.com/uber/okbuck/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/uber/okbuck/actions)

OkBuck is a gradle plugin that lets developers utilize the [Buck](https://buckbuild.com/) build system on a gradle project.

[Wiki](https://github.com/uber/okbuck/wiki), [中文版](https://github.com/uber/okbuck/blob/master/README-zh.md)

## Installation
These are needed to build with buck
Installation instructions for: [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html), [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)

### Configuration
Set the `ANDROID_NDK` environment variable to point to your android ndk installation

In root project `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.uber:okbuck:0.54.5'
    }
}

repositories {
    jcenter()
}

apply plugin: 'com.uber.okbuck'
```

After applying the plugin, the following tasks will be added to the root project
  +  `buckWrapper` will create a buck wrapper script and various configuration files to invoke buck commands
  +  `okbuck` will generate BUCK files

### Buck Wrapper

Run the buck wrapper task
```bash
./gradlew :buckWrapper
```
This creates a `buckw` wrapper similar to the gradle wrapper

Invoking buck commands via the buck wrapper has several advantages
- Downloads/installs/updates buck
- Minimal overhead to decide when to run `okbuck` before invoking buck (using watchman)
- Handles gracefully, the cases when `okbuck` task fails/is stopped abruptly

Please make sure you have watchman installed for `buckw` to run `okbuck` only when needed. A new `okbuck` run is typically needed when gradle configuration or Android manifest files change. If watchman is not installed, the `okbuck` task in always run before invoking any buck commands.

## Usage

```bash
# List all buck targets
./buckw targets //...

# Build a target
./buckw build <target>

# Install an apk target
./buckw install --run <apk-target>

# Generate an Intellij project
./buckw project
```

See the [Usage](https://github.com/uber/okbuck/blob/master/Usage.md) page for complete details on how to configure OkBuck and Buck.

## Buck Http Cache

To speed up your builds even more, you can use an implementation of [Buck's HTTP Cache API](https://github.com/uber/buck-http-cache) to take advantage of building once and using the same build artifacts on all machines.

## Development

To build OkBuck from source:
- **Java 11+** is required (the plugin itself still targets Java 8 runtime)
- Run `./gradlew build` to build the plugin
- Run `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` to publish to your local Maven repository for testing
